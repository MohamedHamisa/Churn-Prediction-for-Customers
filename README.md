# Churn Prediction for Customers

This project analyzes customer churn data for a telecom company. The goal is to understand the factors influencing churn and discover patterns using SQL queries and Python-based data analysis.

## Overview of the Data

The dataset includes information about telecom customers, with the following columns:  
- **customerID**: Unique identifier for each customer  
- **gender**: Customer's gender (Male, Female)  
- **SeniorCitizen**: Whether the customer is a senior citizen (1 = Yes, 0 = No)  
- **tenure**: Number of months the customer has been with the company  
- **Contract**: Type of customer contract (Month-to-month, One-year, Two-year)  
- **Churn**: Whether the customer has churned (1 = Yes, 0 = No)

## SQL Analysis

The `churn_analysis.sql` file includes queries to analyze customer churn and patterns:

- **Customer Tenure Distribution**:
  ```sql
  SELECT tenure, COUNT(*) AS count
  FROM telecom_customers
  GROUP BY tenure
  ORDER BY tenure;
  ```

- **Churn by Contract Type**:
  ```sql
  SELECT Contract, COUNT(*) AS churn_count
  FROM telecom_customers
  WHERE Churn = 1
  GROUP BY Contract;
  ```

- **Senior Citizens Churn**:
  ```sql
  SELECT SeniorCitizen, COUNT(*) AS churn_count
  FROM telecom_customers
  WHERE Churn = 1
  GROUP BY SeniorCitizen;
  ```

## Python Analysis

The `churn_analysis.py` script contains the following steps:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Handles missing data and encoding categorical variables.  
2. **Feature Engineering**: Includes transformations such as log transformations to handle data skewness.  
3. **Modeling**: Trains a Random Forest classifier to predict customer churn.  
4. **Evaluation**: Generates confusion matrices and classification reports for model evaluation.  

## Visualizations

- Customer tenure distribution  
- Churn rate by contract type  
- Churn rate by senior citizen status  

## Requirements

Install the required libraries using:  
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## How to Run

1. **SQL Queries**: Run the SQL queries in the `sql_queries/churn_analysis.sql` file on your database.  
2. **Python Script**: Use the following command to run the Python script:  
   ```bash
   python scripts/churn_analysis.py
   ```
3. **Jupyter Notebook**: Open the Jupyter Notebook in `notebooks/churn_analysis.ipynb` for interactive analysis.

## Results

The analysis revealed several insights:  
- Customers with month-to-month contracts tend to churn more.  
- Senior citizens have a higher churn rate compared to non-senior customers.  
- Customers with shorter tenures are more likely to churn.
